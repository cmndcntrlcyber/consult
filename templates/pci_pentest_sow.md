# Background

The Client is a leading manufacturer of high-quality steel anvils. Recent
academic research indicates that the density of a falling anvil may serve as an
effective means to control fast-moving land-based pests.

The Consultant estimates, using conservative assumptions, that expansion of the
Client's marketing into a new pest control segment may accrete an additional $2
billion in annual revenue to the Client. However, without a definitive proof of
concept, this opportunity remains speculative.

As a highly experienced pursuer of roadrunners, the Consultant is ideally
suited to supply a proof of concept of anvil usage in pest control by crushing
a roadrunner with an Acme anvil.

# Goals

The Consultant shall crush a roadrunner by dropping a 500-pound anvil produced
by the Client ("the Anvil") on the roadrunner from an elevated position,
providing documentary film evidence ("the Deliverable") of the use of anvils in
pest control.

# Project Details

Crushing of the Roadrunner will be achieved via the following steps:

- The Client shall supply the Anvil to the Consultant free of charge.
- The Consultant shall, at his discretion and expense, select an elevated
  position (such as a cliff or hot air balloon) from which to drop the Anvil.
- The Consultant shall wait for a roadrunner to pass underneath the elevated
  position.
- The Consultant shall drop the Anvil on the roadrunner, killing it.

Production of the Deliverable will be achieved by a professional film crew
selected by the Consultant at his discretion and expense.

The Consultant shall transmit the Deliverable to the Client within **30
calendar days** of receipt of the Anvil.

# Responsibilities

The Client is responsible for reasonably prompt delivery of the Anvil.

The Consultant is responsible for crushing a roadrunner with the Anvil,
production of the Deliverable, and timely transmission of the Deliverable to
the Client. However, the Consultant explicity disclaims responsibility for loss
or damage to the Anvil after it is dropped.

# Pricing and Terms

The Client shall pay the Consultant a firm flat fee of **$123,000** as
consideration for the Deliverable.

Payment shall consist of two installments: $61,500 upon full execution of this
Statement of Work and $61,500 upon satisfactory receipt of the Deliverable. The
Consultant shall furnish an invoice to the Client for each of these
installments.
